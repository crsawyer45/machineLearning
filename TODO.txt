maybe make all operations for rotating cube be numpy for speed

ensure that the cross product turns are accurate

constructor that creates a cube with a given cube state from either a vector of pieces or with colors
if its a vector of pieces, possibly match the colors of the piece to where it is
this is simple for the coordinate representation...im unsure if the list representation is needed at all
and things would be easier if it isnt
